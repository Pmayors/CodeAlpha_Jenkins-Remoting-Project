Jenkins Distributed Build System on AWS
A comprehensive Jenkins remoting setup demonstrating distributed builds across multiple specialized agents on AWS EC2 infrastructure.

🚀 Features

Multi-Agent Distribution: Specialized agents for different build types
Security Hardened: SSH key authentication, disabled controller executors
Cross-Platform: Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows agent support
Docker Integration: Container building and deployment
Pipeline Automation: Complete CI/CD workflow
AWS Cloud Ready: EC2 optimized configurations

📋 Prerequisites
AWS Resources

AWS Account with EC2 access
4 EC2 instances (1 controller + 3 agents)
Security groups configured
SSH key pairs for EC2 access

Local Requirements

SSH client
AWS CLI (optional)
Text editor for configuration

🔧 Pipeline Workflow
The included Jenkinsfile demonstrates a complete distributed build:
Stage 1: Maven Build (agentmaven)

Clones Spring PetClinic from GitHub
Compiles Java application with Maven
Packages JAR artifact
Stashes artifact for later stages

Stage 2: Windows Tasks (windows)

Executes Windows-specific commands
Demonstrates batch and PowerShell execution
Archives task outputs

Stage 3: Docker Build (agentdocker)

Retrieves Maven-built artifact
Creates dynamic Dockerfile
Builds Docker image
Pushes to Docker Hub

Stage 4: Deployment (agentdocker)

Deploys container from latest image
Performs health checks
Provides deployment status

🔒 Security Features

SSH Key Authentication: ED25519 keys for agent connections
Least Privilege: Dedicated jenkins user accounts
Controller Isolation: Executors disabled on controller
Network Segmentation: Security groups restrict access
Credential Management: Jenkins credential store integration

📊 Monitoring
Health Checks

Jenkins UI: Node status indicators
System logs: /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
Agent logs: Individual agent log directories
Container health: Docker health checks

Performance Metrics

Build execution times
